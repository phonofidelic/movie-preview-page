# Movie Preview Page

In this project, we build a simple HTML structure for a movie preview page. We start by structuring the semantic markup so that the page content can be correctly interpreted by assistive technologies such as screen readers and by search engines.

CSS style rules are then added and the markup is adjusted with class names and layout elements such as `<div>` and `<span>`.

The markup has been validated with  [Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).

The result can be viewed at https://phonofidelic.github.io/movie-preview-page

## Running with vite dev server

This project uses [Yarn and Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/#getting-started) for hot-reloading during development.

1. Install dependencies with `yarn`
2. Run the dev server with `yarn dev`

Alternatively, a VSCode extension such as [Live server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) can be used to watch `index.html` for changes.
